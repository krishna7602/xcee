        Getting a ticket is easy. Simply provide your name and email address,
        and we’ll email your ticket instantly. We’ll send you an event schedule
        and a few reminders in the days leading up to the event. But don’t
        wait—free tickets are only available until October 1st. We will be
        charging $50 per ticket thereafter, if we even have the bandwidth to do
        so.
